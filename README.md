# AppSocially SDK

## Introduction

### Overview

AppSocially provides app builders with an in-house "Growth" team. These tools mirror the best user-acquisition practices from companies like AirBnB, Facebook and Uber.

These companies devote huge resources to develop custom sharing experiences, custom landing pages, and custom tracking dashboards so they can test, track, and discover what works best for them.
With AppSocially, you too can benefit from the bulk of their learnings. Simply install and configure the SDK and your user acquisition funnel will blow up in no time.

### AppSocially can help you to:

* Quickly create unified contact lists for use in sending invites
* Send 1-to-1 invites on Facebook, email, and sms
* Send 1-to-many shares on Facebook and Twitter
* Generate custom landing pages for each individual invite or share
* Embed custom relevant content in each landing page
* A/B test landing pages
* View each individual landing page's performance, or chart invite/share/ landing page performance in aggregate
* Track your entire funnel, from invite, to install, to conversion, and back to invite.
* Create referral codes and reward users and their friends for inviting and joining respectively. [COMING SOON]

### Send 1-to-1 invites on Facebook, email, and sms
Our customizable UI Views can be installed with just one line of code

### Quickly create unified contact lists for use in sending invites

####Invite API

#####ActionSheet type
You can display invite function in Actionsheete 

(Image)

Import Appsocially SDK in your class

````
#import <AppSocially/AppSocially.h>
````

Call a method anywhere in your class

````
[ASInviter showInviteSheetInView:self.view];
````

#####Aggregated Friend Picker type
You can display aggregated friend list like below. This function is only invite function via mail and address book.

![sample2](http://appsocially-docs-resources.s3.amazonaws.com/ss_InviteSmaple__.png)

Import Appsocially SDK in your class

````
#import <AppSocially/AppSocially.h>
````

Call below methods anywhere in your class.

###### Present aggregated frined picker

Same as usual UIViewController subclasses.

````
ASFriendPickerViewController *pickerCtr = [[ASFriendPickerViewController alloc] init];
pickerCtr.delegate = self;

// customize here

[self presentViewController:pickerCtr animated:YES completion:nil];
````

Implement the delegate methods.

````
- (void)friendPickerViewController:(ASFriendPickerViewController *)controller
                  didPickedFriends:(NSArray *)friends
{
    self.pickedFriends = friends;
    
    [controller dismissViewControllerAnimated:YES
                                   completion:^{
                                       // do something after friends being picked
                                   }];
}
````

To enable invitation via Twitter, you should **set an ACAccount object** as below:

````
- (void)twitterAccountDidSelect:(ACAccount *)account {

    [ASInviter setSenderAccount:account type:ASInviteTypeTwitterDM];
}
````

It's needed because of the multi-account support.


######Invite friends picked from the Friend Picker

Call inviteFriends method.

[ASInviter inviteFriends:self.pickedFriends
              inviteInfo:inviteInfo

### 4. Display customized data on landing You are able to set customized data as properties of "data" object on landing pages.

(eg) "data.video_url."

**The property names are left to developers.**

####How to send the property values from the app

You can send the properties from the app as follows:

#####When using ASInvitor

Set the properties to the argument "inviteInfo" as an object of NSDictionary.

(Sample1)
````
NSDictionary *inviteInfo = @{@"video_url": urlStr,
                             @"message": msgStr};
[ASInviter inviteVia:ASInviteTypeTwitterDM
          inviteInfo:inviteInfo
          completion:nil];
````

(Sample2)
````
NSDictionary *inviteInfo = @{@"video_url": urlStr,
                             @"message": msgStr};
[ASInviter inviteFriends:self.pickedFriends
              inviteInfo:inviteInfo
        onViewController:self
         withMessageForm:NO
              completion:nil];
````

#####When using ASSharer **(In Progress)**

Set the properties to the argument "shareInfo" as an object of NSDictionary.

## FAQ
###Invite API

####Q: Is it possible to add a picture (from the device) to the inviation?  We would really like to be able to show a visual with the invitation text in the invitee's Facebook Wall.

A: You can add pictures into the generated landing pages by passing `inviteInfo` as below:

````
NSDictionary *inviteInfo = @{kDataPropertyContentURL: [UIImage imageNamed:@"filename"]};

[ASInviter inviteVia:ASInviteTypeFacebookMessage
          inviteInfo:inviteInfo
          completion:nil];
````

And add `{{content_url}}` into the place where you'd like to display in your page template from our dashboard.

See also: [Display customized data on landing pages](https://github.com/appsocially/AppSocially-iOS-SDK/wiki/Display-customized-data-on-landing-pages)

####Q: How can I make an ASFriend object for Twitter manually?
A: You can use `initWithDetail:type:` and put the NSDictionary object which is retrieved from Twitter API (e.g. friends/ids.json) for the "detail" argument.

````
ASFriend *friend = [[ASFriend alloc] initWithDetail:dictionaryFromTwitterAPI
                                               type:ASFriendTypeTwitter];
````


###Share API

####Q: How can I change the default message in the SHARE composer?

A: The share related functions in ASSharer have "shareInfo" properties or arguments. You can pass a string value for a kDataPropertyMessage key, and it become the default (preset) message in the share composer.

````
NSDictionary *shareInfo = @{kDataPropertyMessage: @"This is preset message"};
````
